    find_edge(edges, edge) - see line 787 main.py



Notes from meet w Victor 12/26

next steps:
Encode game state
Dice
Resources
Player hands
Current player turn:
    Dice roll
    Collect resources

use same seed for dice randomization to make testing easier

client 'action' should be defined before it currently is
    currently mouse hover appears over nodes even when move_robber is selected, but only valid inputs should be highlighted with the mouse hover

client - player should have different 'states'/'actions':
    (could make to enum)
    action: dice roll - only highlight dice/ make dice selectable. everything else not highlighted
    action: None

Turn steps

Client:
    roll dice
    play soldier card - move robber and steal card

if (dice == 7){
    return cards check for all players
    move robber
    steal card
}
else{
    distribute resources to all players
}



client requests mode change locally and passes to server
server receives mode request and confirms if it is possible
server returns decision to client:
    if mouse over, return hover
    if mouse click, return action

client requests mode change back by clicking mode

server should validate mode change/ end turn/ dice roll

turn_phases:
start:
    actions:
        roll dice, play soldier
    modes:
        robber
main:
    actions:
        buy or play development card
    modes:
        build
        trading

end = turn over turn to next player and make mode roll_dice

dice_roll mode 
Essentially can split up turns into two phases: dice roll and main phase
