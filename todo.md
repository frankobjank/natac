Current todo:
    add dice check after move_robber() and steal() (and all dev_card_modes)



Ideas:
things to add to info_box:
    put player selection for stealing at mode "steal"
    put card selection for discarding at mode "discard_cards"

to add to hand UI:
    when selecting something to trade away or discard, show -> minus cards
        when gaining a card, show -> add cards



Known bugs:
Bug 1 - submit button not working --- !!!
Bug 2 - end turn button hover sticking
Bug 3 - When another player enters game after game start, skips some players' turns. This probably won't be an issue in a real game since all players must enter before starting the game.
